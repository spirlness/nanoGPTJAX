# KVCache

The new kvcache implementation for forward pass where prompts are left-padded, and generated sequences are right-aligned works well without jit. JIT also
works but with `cudnn` attention implementation right now, it's throwing some error that corresponds to some layout issues. It works well with other `xla` or `None`, but after a point the output diverges from the actual output obtained with `cudnn`. This issue has already been raised with the JAX team.

For now, here are the new version of prefill, and decode we have to include in the code once we figure out to deal with the errors. These work perfectly without JIT. Take utmost care when expanding the dimensions after prefill. We always have to expand the last dimension.

```python
devices = np.array(jax.devices())
mesh = Mesh(devices, axis_names=BATCH_AXIS_NAME)
sharding_rules = ShardingRules(batch=BATCH_AXIS_NAME)
cfg = Config(mesh=mesh, rules=sharding_rules)

```

We got rid of the above bug by explicitly copying the `k` and `v` values into new arrays. Without creating an extra copy, it is not possible
to make the array contiguous as transpose is just a view in the end. It works now.

# Optimizations

- We still have not applied any tricks, yet the throughput, the optimization, and the model outputs all are in great shape.
- I am not sure how important the document boundary is for pretraining. As of now, the grain processes takes 500MB on
each GPU which is not good, and because of the process finding bos tokens and generating sequences on the fly, there
are times when the GPU utilization becomes poor. Though it's not that bad, but I would love to get rid of any bubble in the data loading pipeline. 


## 1 Optimizer: AdamW and Muon

- Both adamw and muon works well. We achieve the same validation loss as achieved by `nanochat` and `modded-nanogpt`.
- Though it is straightforward to use muon in JAX (thanks to Optax!), but there are a few nuances that one needs to be aware of. Muon can be applied to any high rank array, but we need to make it aware of those dimensions, otherwise those leaves won't get muon benefits. For example, in our codebase the attention weights are 3D arrays as opposed to 2D. The reason we have kept them in 3D is because sharding becomes extremely easy. A side effect of this is that we need to
make muon aware of this to ensure that arrays are rehsape properly for orthogonalization, otheriwse they are assumed to be 2D.

Here is an example:

```python
ef make_muon(lr_schedule, weight_decay=0.0):
    def muon_dims_fn(p):
        def choose(x):
            s = getattr(x, "shape", None)
            if s is None:
                return None
            if len(s) == 2:
                return optax.contrib.MuonDimensionNumbers((0,), (1,))
            if len(s) == 3:
                if s[-1] == d_model:
                    return optax.contrib.MuonDimensionNumbers((0, 1), (2,))
                return optax.contrib.MuonDimensionNumbers((0,), (1, 2))
            return None
        return jax.tree_util.tree_map(choose, p)

    def wd_mask_fn(p):
        def keep(x):
            s = getattr(x, "shape", None)
            return s is not None and len(s) >= 2
        return jax.tree_util.tree_map(keep, p)

    optim = optax.contrib.muon(
        learning_rate=lr_schedule,
        ns_coeffs=(3.4445, -4.775, 2.0315),
        ns_steps=5,
        beta=b2,
        eps=1e-8,
        weight_decay=weight_decay,
        weight_decay_mask=wd_mask_fn,
        mu_dtype=jnp.float32,
        nesterov=True,
        adaptive=False,
        adam_b1=b1,
        adam_b2=b2,
        adam_eps_root=0.0,
        adam_weight_decay=weight_decay,
        adam_learning_rate=None,
        muon_weight_dimension_numbers=muon_dims_fn,
    )
```

Though the above implementation works perfectly and converges very quickly compared to `AdamW`, we take a big hit on the throughput. For example, if a single
H100 instance was processing almost 400K tokens/second with `adamw`, switching to the above will reduce the throughput to 300-330K tokens/second.
That's a big hit!

Why the drop, one may ask? The `Newton–Schulz orthogonalization` adds extra matmuls, and if you flatten across a sharded axis it also triggers extra cross‑device collectives. Both effects reduce tokens/s by roughly 5–15% in practice. An easy to get back close to the original throughput is to ensure Muon orthogonalize “locally” by treating the sharded head axis as a batch axis (so no collectives across heads). For example, `wq/wk/wv (d_emb, heads, head_dim): use reduction=(0,), output=(2,)` and leave heads as batch. Similarly, `wo (heads, head_dim, d_emb): use reduction=(1,), output=(2,)` and leave heads as batch. This still gives the intended 2D matrix per head, but avoids flattening across heads. Optax supports this directly via muon_weight_dimension_numbers. We can
also bring down Newton–Schulz iterations to 3. 

```python
def make_weight_dim_nums(p):
    def choose(x):
        s = getattr(x, "shape", None)
        if s is None:
            return None
        if len(s) == 2:
            return optax.contrib.MuonDimensionNumbers((0,), (1,))
        if len(s) == 3:
            if s[-1] == d_model: # wo: (heads, head_dim, d_model)
                return optax.contrib.MuonDimensionNumbers((1,), (2,))
            return optax.contrib.MuonDimensionNumbers((0,), (2,))  # wq/wk/wv: batch=heads
        return None
    return jax.tree_util.tree_map(choose, p)


def weight_decay_mask_fn(p):
    def keep(x):
        s = getattr(x, "shape", None)
        return s is not None and len(s) >= 2
    return jax.tree_util.tree_map(keep, p)


muon_weight_dim_nums = make_weight_dim_nums(params)
muon_wd_mask = weight_decay_mask_fn(params)

def make_muon(lr_schedule, weight_decay=0.0):
    return optax.contrib.muon(
        learning_rate=lr_schedule,
        ns_coeffs=(3.4445, -4.775, 2.0315),
        ns_steps=3,
        beta=b2,
        eps=1e-8,
        weight_decay=weight_decay,
        weight_decay_mask=muon_wd_mask,
        mu_dtype=jnp.float32,
        nesterov=True,
        adaptive=False,
        adam_b1=b1,
        adam_b2=b2,
        adam_eps_root=0.0,
        adam_weight_decay=weight_decay,
        adam_learning_rate=None,
        muon_weight_dimension_numbers=muon_dims_fn,
    )
```

## 2 GPU Usage

We want to squeeze out of our GPUs as much as possible. Though after a certain point, DDP is not a very good strategy to use, we have to live with it for now.
We will expand the model depth and width in the next version, and will improve a lot of key aspects listed here. 

**Note:** Earlier it was noted that GPU flags may have not have that drastic performance difference, but turned out they are important, and have been added back.


### 2.1 Data Pipeline

- Our dataloader uses multithreading with prefetching. Earlier we used multiprocessing which may have provided better results, but for some reason grain
multiprocess starts using GPU memory (around 512 MB/worker) when the worker count is greater than 1. I tried everything I could think of to avoid it, but it
kept eating valuable GPU memory, hence switched to multithreading with prefetching.
- Though we are prefetching, there can still be bubbles in the data pipeline and may lead to a poor GPU usage. To avoid that, we keep an extra buffer of `uint16`
(as the original data is in in uint16) of size `(bsz, seqlen + 1)`, and we keep refilling it instead of creating a new buffer every time `next_batch` is called.
We then transfer this entire buffer to the GPUs and then create inputs-targets pair. This is better than creating pairs first and then transferring the pairs
to the GPUs as in that case we need to move two buffers to the HBM from the host.

### 2.2 Gradient Accumulation

- Though we tried to keep the GPU as busy as we can in the above steps, that pipeline has still some bubbles and we can squeeze those GPUs even more. The problem
is that we cannot increase the per device batch size more than we already have as it will OOM. We can apply gradient accumulation to mirror an increased 
effective batch size.
- It is easy to use gradient accumulation in optax. We just need to apply `optim = optax.MultiSteps(optim, every_k_schedule=grad_accum_steps)`. There are no more
changes needed, and rest of the training loop remain as is. 
- Though the above works, it does not let you squeeze the GPU performance. There is a way to do that wehere you write one normal `train_step`, and another `train_accum_step`. Both are similar except that we do not update parameters in one of them. By doing so we avoid the no-op update and writing all the weights to HBM at each accumulation step. Ideally it should work, but I guess there is some bug in optax. We have opened an [issue](https://github.com/google-deepmind/optax/issues/1567#issuecomment-3795034778) regarding the same
- For the time being, we have switched to custom gradient accumulation. 

```python
@partial(jax.jit, static_argnames=("optim", "grad_accum_steps"), donate_argnums=(0, 1, 4))
def train_step_accum(params, x_batch, y_batch, freqs, optim_state, optim, grad_accum_steps):
    # x_batch, y_batch: [grad_accum_steps, bsz, seqlen]
    def body(carry, xy):
        curr_param, grad_sum, loss_sum = carry
        curr_x, curr_x = xy
        (loss, _), curr_grad = jax.value_and_grad(compute_loss, has_aux=True)(curr_param, curr_x, curr_y, freqs)
        grad_sum = jax.tree_util.tree_map(lambda a, b: a + b, grad_sum, curr_grad)
        loss_sum = loss_sum + loss
        return (curr_param, grad_sum, loss_sum), None

    g0 = jax.tree_util.tree_map(jnp.zeros_like, params)
    carry0 = (params, g0, jnp.array(0.0, dtype=jnp.result_type(0.0)))
    (p, gsum, lsum), _ = jax.lax.scan(body, carry0, (x_batch, y_batch), length=grad_accum_steps)

    steps = grad_accum_steps
    gsum = jax.tree_util.tree_map(lambda g: g / steps, gsum)
    loss = lsum / steps

    updates, optim_state = optim.update(gsum, optim_state, p)
    params = optax.apply_updates(p, updates)
    return params, loss, optim_state
```


# 3. Cautious Weight Decay

Very cool idea from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12402) The idea is simple yet very effective: **Apply weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose signs align with the optimizer update.** We can implement it very quickly by adding one more gradient transformation as shown below:

```python
def cautious_decay(schedule, wd):
        def init_fn(params):
            return {"count": jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.int32)}

        def update_fn(updates, state, params=None):
            step = state["count"]
            scale = schedule(step)
            if params is None:
                return updates, {"count": step + 1}

            def apply_updates(update, param):
                if param is None:
                    return update
                s = getattr(param, "shape", None)
                eligible_for_update = (s is not None) and (len(s) >= 2)
                if not eligible_for_update:
                    return update
                # Cautious: only decay when update and param are aligned (same sign)
                decay = jnp.where(
                    (update * param) >= 0,
                    param.astype(update.dtype),
                    jnp.zeros_like(update),
                )
                # Subtract to apply weight decay (moves parameters toward zero)
                return update - (scale * wd) * decay

            new_updates = jax.tree_util.tree_map(apply_updates, updates, params)
            return new_updates, {"count": step + 1}

        return optax.GradientTransformation(init_fn, update_fn)
```

# SFT

When doing mid-training or SFT, we need to do a few changes. Though we should train the model on a decent mix of datasets as used in `nanochat`, here I trained the model only one of the datasets for the sake of demonstration. We will train the model on all dataset, but the size of the current model (160M) is too small for that many number of tokens. We need to scale the model size first before doing that. I just want to ensure each and every component of every pipeline (Pretrain -> Mid-train -> Post-train) is working as expected before I start scaling the datset and the model sizes.

## 1. CE loss with prompt masking

Because most of the dataset used in mid-training/SFT will consists of role-based conversations (system, user, tool-call), we need to have the ability to train the model only on completions. Though the decison of "to mask or to not" heavily depends on the dataset size and the completion length, once we start scaling,
masking non-completion tokens during training makes more sense.

```python
def compute_loss(params, x_batch, y_batch, segment_ids, freqs, loss_mask):
    """Corss-entropy loss with masked tokens"""
    logits = forward(params, x_batch, segment_ids, freqs)
    if loss_mask is not None:
        per_token_loss = optax.losses.softmax_cross_entropy_with_integer_labels(
            logits=logits,
            labels=y_batch,
            where=loss_mask,
        )
        return jnp.sum(per_token_loss) / jnp.maximum(jnp.sum(loss_mask), 1.0)
    else:
        return jnp.mean(
            optax.losses.softmax_cross_entropy_with_integer_labels(
                logits=logits, labels=y_batch
            )
        )
```


## 2. Dataloader - DO NOT WASTE TOKENS

Preparing pretraining dataset is easy. You append the BOS token, ensure all sequences have sufficient length, and that's it. With SFT, things start to
complicate a bit on the data loader side. If our sequence length or context window length is 2048, there is a high chance that a big fraction of the SFT
data used to train the models won't have that many tokens. We have two choices there:

- Pad the sequences to max sequence length (utter waste of compute!)
- Do sequence packing but with a very good algorithm (BestFit in our case!)

When we do seuqnece packing, we also need information on which tokens belong to which sample in the sequence. This is where `segment_ids` comes handy. But wait,
why is that information necessary? What can go wrong if you do not have segment information? Well, if you do not have the segment information, your positional
information about the tokens will be a sequence of 2048 positions. The entire RoPE calculation will be wrong. This is why we need to compute the
frequencies on the fly as opposed to static calculation during pretraining.

Also, we would tokenize and save the sequence rather than doing tokenization on fly as it will be extremely skow

```python
# Assuming we have tokenized the dataset and saved it in parqauet files already
paths_ds = grain.MapDataset.source(shard_paths)
per_file = paths_ds.map(lambda p: grain.experimental.ParquetIterDataset(p))

ds = grain.experimental.InterleaveIterDataset(
    per_file,
    cycle_length=min(cycle_length, len(shard_paths)),
    num_make_iter_threads=num_make_iter_threads,
    make_iter_buffer_size=make_iter_buffer_size,
    iter_buffer_size=iter_buffer_size,
)
if shuffle:
    ds = ds.shuffle(shuffle_seed)

ds = ds.map(decode_mask_from_ids)
ds = ds.map(partial(truncate_to_seqlen, max_len=packed_len))
ds = ds.filter(has_completion_tokens)

length_struct = {"input_ids": packed_len, "completion_mask": packed_len}
# We need to tell the iterator what pad `id` to use for input_ids and completion_mask
# For input_ids, we will use the padding id from our tokenizer. For completions mask,
# we will pad it using zeros, as they are going to filtered anyway.
padding_struct={"input_ids": pad_id, "completion_mask": 0}

ds = grain.experimental.BestFitPackIterDataset(
    parent=ds,
    length_struct=length_struct,
    num_packing_bins=num_packing_bins,
    max_sequences_per_bin=max_sequences_per_bin,
    padding_struct=padding_struct,
)

total_batch_size = grad_accum_steps * batch_size if grad_accum_steps > 1 else batch_size

if multi_threading:
    ds = grain.experimental.multithread_prefetch(
        ds, num_threads=prefetch_threads, buffer_size=prefetch_buffer_size
    )

ds = ds.batch(total_batch_size, drop_remainder=True)

if grad_accum_steps > 1:
    ds = ds.map(partial(prepare_train_accum_batch, grad_accum_steps=grad_accum_steps))
else:
    ds = ds.map(prepare_train_batch)

if data_sharding is not None:
    ds = grain.experimental.device_put(
        ds,
        device=data_sharding,
        cpu_buffer_size=cpu_buffer_size,
        device_buffer_size=device_buffer_size,
    )
return ds
```

### KVCache improved

We verified the new inference path by comparing three variants: the original no-cache forward(...), a no-cache explicit-
mask reference, and the KV-cache inference path. The original path and the explicit-mask reference matched exactly,
which confirmed that the local/global mask logic and RoPE/NoPE behavior are correct. The observed greedy decoding
divergence came only from the full-buffer KV-cache path, and further debugging showed that it disappears when attention
is run on a compact active-KV slice instead of the full backing buffer. This means the issue is not a cache indexing or
masking bug, but a numerical effect: in bf16, attending over the full 2048-slot buffer with most entries masked out
introduces enough extra flash-attention tiling/rescaling noise to break exact ties in logits and change greedy token
selection. So the inference implementation is functionally correct, but exact greedy equivalence is only guaranteed with
the compact active-KV path, not with the full-buffer masked cache path.

# nanoGPTJAX

This project is inspired by Karpathy's [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) and [nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat), with one major difference: here we build everything from scratch in **pure JAX (on both GPUs and TPUs)**, avoiding higher-level third-party model/training libraries. This is not meant to start another PyTorch vs. JAX debate—I use both on a daily basis, and both are good in their own right. There are a few reasons I keep using JAX:

1. I am not a fan of the OOP paradigm for deep learning. It is often nice to have, but not required.
2. Nothing comes close to distributed training in JAX. The mental model is simple and fits well with the philosophy of having control over every design aspect of a training run.
3. Reproducibility is a first-class citizen in JAX.
4. I like having fine-grained control over implementation and performance details without fighting framework abstractions.

It is recommended to read the [design philosophy](notes/design.md) to better understand how this works under the hood. <br>

## Architecture

We follow the standard Transformer architecture, with the following choices:

- Grouped Query Attention (GQA)
- No weight tying
- RoPE
- QK-Norm
- Logits soft-capping
- ReLU-squared activations in the MLP/SwiGLU
- RMSNorm without learnable parameters
- Muon/AdamW

The models here can be trained with both `AdamW` and `Muon` optimizers (via Optax). You can use any sharding strategy depending on the size of the model. We use the cached, tokenized **FineWeb10B** dataset as in [modded-nanogpt](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt).

## Getting Started

1. Install uv
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv --version
```

2. Create a `venv`
```
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```
uv sync

# If you are running the code on GPUs, run this instead:
uv sync --all-extras
```

4. Prepare the dataset for pretraining
```
# Download the dataset
python download_fineweb_tokens.py
```

5. Train the model
```
# Pass the data dir path in the config file located at `nanochat/config.py`
# Change the hparams in the file if you want.
python nanogpt/train.py
```

6. (Optional) Fine-tune model on conversational dataset
```
# Prepare the SFT dataset. Change args if you want to
python sft_downloader.py

# Fine-tune the model using the above data
python train_sft.py
```

7. Run inference by providing the checkpoint path
```
# Change this in the config file. Load the checkpoint 
# that is appropriate for the task (pretrain results/SFT results)
load_ckpt_path = /home/.../params  # absolute path only

# Run the inference code
python nanogpt/inference.py
```
<br>

## Results

#### Pretraining

After pretraining the model on first 30 shards of Fineweb10B tokens, here are some sample outputs from the mode:

```
temperature = 0.8
top_k = 100
max_new_tokens = 50
prompts = [
        "<|endoftext|>Did you notice that this world",
        "<|endoftext|>Hello World! My dear",
        "<|endoftext|>Some say we are tired far",
        "<|endoftext|>The capital of France",
    ]


Completions:

<|endoftext|>Did you notice that this world is filled with so many people and so many ideas?
Well, I’m going to tell you about a few of them that I personally love.
One is an article written for a few local blogs, one is for a national magazine

#### Midtrain/SFT

After fine-tuning the model on a very small dataset (smoltalk, MMLU, ang GSM8K) for 500 steps, here are some results:

```
prompt:

<|endoftext|><|user_start|>What are the benefits of regular exercise? Your response should contain at least 3 sentences. Include keywords such as "health", "reduce", and "improve".
<|user_end|>
<|assistant_start|>


completion:

Regular exercise enhances cognitive abilities, promoting cognitive strength, focus, and attention. It improves circulation and reduces symptoms of illness, such as exhaustion and muscle cramps. Additionally, regular exercise lowers your cholesterol level to preserve cardiovascular control while minimizing side effects (like
```
**Note:**

1. For the base version (12 layers), we fine-tuned it on a small dataset (smoltalk, MMLU, GSM8K) with *completion-only* training.
2. For SFT, we use Adam with no weight decay instead of Muon.

## Benchmarking 

As of now without using any tricks, the training loss converges in around ~16 minutes on `4 X H100` machine. The dataloader is not optimal,
we have not included gradient accumulation, we have not used any tricks to improve the convergence. Still, 16 minutes is neither bad nor great.
I am sure we can do it in under 5-8 minutes soon without using many tricks. 🤞

We will soon add a table that will list down the runs with changes in code and performance improvements.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Apart from bug fixes, the task list above is a good start for contributions.

- **Before you start:** Please open an issue to discuss significant changes (new features, refactors, training pipeline changes).
- **Branching:** Create a feature branch from `main` (e.g., `feat/<name>` or `fix/<name>`).
- **Testing:** If you add or change functionality, include minimal tests or a small reproducible script to validate the change.
- **Pull requests:** In your PR description, include (1) what changed, (2) why it changed, and (3) how to reproduce/verify. <br>

We use `ruff` for linting and formatting. You can either manually run `ruff check nanogpt/*.py` and `ruff format nanogpt/*.py` before sending a PR or you can
install `pe-commit` and will do the job for you. To install pre-commit, use the following command:

```
uv tool install pre-commit --with pre-commit-uv
```
